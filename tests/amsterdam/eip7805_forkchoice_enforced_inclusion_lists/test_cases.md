# EIP-7805 FOCIL Test Cases

| Function Name | Goal | Setup | Expectation | Status |
|---------------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Inclusion list Building** |
| `test_focil_inclusion_list_builder_respects_size_limit` | Ensure the inclusion list builder does not create a list that exceeds the `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST` limit. | Provide the builder with more transactions than can fit within the size limit. | The builder MUST create an inclusion list that is less than or equal to the size limit. It MUST NOT produce an oversized list. | 游리 Planned |
| **Block Validation** |
| `test_focil_block_validation_accepts_empty_inclusion_list` | Verify the EL correctly validates a payload with an empty inclusion list. | The EL receives a payload and an empty inclusion list. | The payload MUST be considered valid. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_block_validation_accepts_full_inclusion_list` | Verify the EL validates a payload correctly including transactions from a maximally sized inclusion list. | The EL receives a payload and an inclusion list filled to the `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST` * inclusion list Committee Size limit. All valid inclusion list txs are included. | The payload MUST include all txs. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_block_validation_ignores_invalid_txs_in_inclusion_list` | Ensure the EL validates a block that correctly omits invalid transactions found in the inclusion list. | The EL receives a payload and an inclusion list which contains entries with invalid transactions (intrinsically invalid, bad nonce, sender cannot afford the gas, bad encoding, eip-4844 txs, etc.). |  These invalid txs MUST *not* be included in the block body. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_block_validation_reorgs_if_valid_inclusion_list_tx_is_omitted` | Verify a block is reorged if it omits a transaction that is valid against the current state and referenced by corresponding inclusion list for that slot. | The inclusion list references a transaction valid against the current state, but the block body omits it. | The block MUST be reorged. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_block_validation_succeeds_with_interdependent_inclusion_list_txs` | Verify that when an inclusion list contains txs where later ones depend on earlier ones. | Inclusion list is `[tx_A, tx_B]`. `tx_A` funds a new account. `tx_B` is a transaction sent from that new account.  | Both txs MUST be included. | 游리 Planned |
| **Block Building** |
| `test_focil_builder_includes_valid_inclusion_list_txs` | Ensure the produced block includes all valid transactions from the provided inclusion list. | The EL is asked to build a block with an inclusion list containing several valid transactions. | The produced block MUST contain all the valid transactions from the inclusion list. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_builder_ignores_invalid_inclusion_list_txs` | Ensure `produce_execution_payload` does not include inclusion list transactions that are invalid against the parent state. | The EL is asked to build a block with an inclusion list containing a mix of valid and invalid (e.g., bad nonce) transactions. | The produced block MUST include the valid inclusion list transactions and MUST NOT include the invalid ones. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_builder_handles_empty_inclusion_list` | Ensure a valid block is built when the inclusion list is empty. | The EL is asked to build a block with an empty inclusion list. | The builder MUST produce a valid block. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_focil_builder_handles_inclusion_list_tx_becoming_invalid` | Ensure builder correctly omits an inclusion list transaction that becomes invalid due to a preceding inclusion list transaction. | The inclusion list is `[tx_A, tx_B]`. Both are from the same EOA with nonce `N`. Both are valid against the parent state. | The builder MUST include `tx_A`. `tx_B` (with nonce `N`) becomes invalid and MUST be omitted from the block. | 游리 Planned |
