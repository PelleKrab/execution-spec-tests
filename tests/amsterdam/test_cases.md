# EIP-7805 FOCIL Test Cases (Revised Structure)

| Function Name | Goal | Setup | Expectation | Status |
|---------------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Inclusion List Building** |
| `test_il_builder_creates_valid_list_from_txs` | Ensure the IL builder can take a set of transactions and correctly format them into a valid `InclusionList` structure. | Provide the builder with a list of raw signed transactions and their intended beneficiaries. | The builder MUST produce a structurally valid `InclusionList` where each transaction is correctly paired with its beneficiary. The list must be properly encoded. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_il_builder_respects_size_limit` | Ensure the IL builder does not create a list that exceeds the `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST` limit. | Provide the builder with more transactions than can fit within the size limit. | The builder MUST create an `InclusionList` that is less than or equal to the size limit. It MUST NOT produce an oversized list. | 游리 Planned |
| **Block Validation** |
| `test_block_validation_accepts_empty_il` | Verify the EL correctly validates a block derived from a payload with an empty Inclusion List. | The EL receives a payload with an empty `inclusion_list` and its corresponding block. | The block and payload MUST be considered valid. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_block_validation_accepts_full_il` | Verify the EL validates a block correctly including transactions from a maximally sized IL. | The EL receives a payload with an `inclusion_list` filled to the `MAX_BYTES_PER_INCLUSION_LIST` * Inclusion List Committee Size limit. All valid IL txs are included. | The block and payload MUST be considered valid. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_block_validation_ignores_invalid_txs_in_il` | Ensure the EL validates a block that correctly omits invalid transactions found in the IL. | The EL receives a payload where the IL contains entries with invalid transactions (bad nonce, etc.). These are correctly *not* included in the block body. | The block and payload MUST be considered valid. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_block_validation_fails_if_valid_il_tx_is_omitted` | Verify a block is invalid if it fails to include a summarily valid transaction from the IL. | A payload's IL contains a transaction that is valid against the parent block's state. The block body, however, omits this transaction. | The block MUST be rejected as invalid. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_block_validation_succeeds_with_interdependent_il_txs` | Verify a block is valid when it includes a sequence of IL txs where later ones depend on earlier ones. | IL is `[tx_A, tx_B]`. `tx_A` funds a new account. `tx_B` is a transaction sent from that new account. Both are included in the correct order. | The block MUST be considered valid. | 游리 Planned |
| **Block Building** |
| `test_builder_includes_valid_il_txs` | Ensure `produce_execution_payload` includes all summarily valid transactions from the provided Inclusion List. | The EL is asked to build a block with an IL containing several valid transactions. The mempool also has transactions. | The produced block's transaction list MUST contain all the summarily valid transactions from the IL. | 游리 Planned || `test_builder_ignores_invalid_il_txs` | Ensure `produce_execution_payload` does not include IL transactions that are invalid against the parent state. | The EL is asked to build a block with an IL containing a mix of valid and invalid (e.g., bad nonce) transactions. | The produced block MUST include the valid IL transactions in the prefix and MUST NOT include the invalid ones. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_builder_handles_empty_il` | Ensure `produce_execution_payload` builds a correct block when the IL is empty. | The EL is asked to build a block with an empty IL. | The builder MUST produce a valid block, likely filled with transactions from the local mempool. | 游리 Planned |
| `test_builder_handles_il_tx_becoming_invalid` | Ensure builder correctly omits an IL transaction that becomes invalid due to a preceding IL transaction. | The IL is `[tx_A, tx_B]`. Both are from the same EOA with nonce `N`. Both are valid against the parent state. | The builder MUST include `tx_A`. `tx_B` (with nonce `N`) becomes invalid and MUST be omitted from the block. | 游리 Planned |
